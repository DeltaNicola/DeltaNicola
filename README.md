# Hi, I'm Nicola! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
Hardworking and passionate Junior Software Developer. I focused my academic career
around trying to learn and understand various programming paradigms rather than
focusing on learning one single programming language. Always eager to learn something new, I started my journey focusing on learning how to effectively build backend web applications. After that, i continued my learning journey experimenting with different front-end frameworks in order to better understand how both parts communicate with each other, gaining the necessary understanding of microservices architecture.  
I then started experimenting with virtualization, using docker, and with IaC with docker compose. I recently started working with Kubernetes, gaining the necessary abilities to understand how it works and how to extend its APIs.
